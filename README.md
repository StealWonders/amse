## Project Setup

The following files are part of this template repository:

[//]: # (- `data.sqlite`: Your final, cleaned dataset. You will create an automated data pipeline that creates this SQLite database from multiple open data sources. The template repository includes data about train stations in germany, you need to replace this with your data!)
- `exploration.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that was used to explore data and show in detail what it looks like.
- `report.ipynb`: The final report as a Jupyter notebook. This is the result of my project work and answers multiple questions using open data.
